    <h2> ABOUT </h2>
    <P>
    As a dynamic second-year Computer Science B.Tech student, my passion for technology, especially in Data Science, fuels my pursuit of internship opportunities. Eager to transcend classroom knowledge, I am on a mission to not just enhance my skills, but to revolutionize how we approach challenges in the tech landscape. Committed to continuous learning and driven by an unwavering work ethic, I am not just seeking an internship; I am actively seeking an immersive experience where I can contribute meaningfully, collaborate passionately, and emerge as a transformative force in the world of technology.
    </P>
